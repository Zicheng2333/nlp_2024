       " 'Althea Morgan, sales assistant at Swept Away, peered with disdain at Kate Bennet, the bookstore\\'s owner, as Kate hurried into the store. \"I expected you at nine. And here it is... \" She checked her watch. \"... Almost _nine forty-two_.\" The woman had her fists planted on her impossibly narrow hips, and her lips were pursed, causing unsightly lines to form around her mouth. \"We\\'ve had a rush, and I had to get orders ready to ship, and I didn\\'t know _when_ you were going to come in, so I had to tell Mr. Belmont that I—\"',\n",
       " '\"Althea.\" Kate had barely gotten in the door, and she was still balancing a stack of books and her purse in her arms.',\n",
       " '\"Now, I know it\\'s probably not my business, but—\"',\n",
       " '\" _Althea_.\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m just saying, it wouldn\\'t hurt you to _call_ —\"',\n",
       " '\"ALTHEA!\"',\n",
       " \"The older woman looked at Kate as though she'd suddenly been awakened from a nap during the REM cycle. She blinked several times, her brightly lipsticked mouth slack.\",\n",
       " '\"I\\'m sorry I\\'m late, but I had some things to attend to. It was inconsiderate of me, you\\'re right. I apologize.\" Kate smiled in what she hoped was a winning way. She teetered over to the counter on heels that were too high and put down her things with a sigh of relief.',\n",
       " 'Althea, who would not reveal her age but was probably somewhere in her late sixties, patted her dark-dyed helmet of hair and straightened the flowing turquoise silk jacket she was wearing over white capris and a white tank. \"Well. It just seems to me that as the _owner_ , you should try to set some sort of _example_....\"',\n",
       " '\"You\\'re right. I\\'m sorry,\" Kate said again.',\n",
       " '\"I just...\"',\n",
       " '\"Did Elliot call? I was expecting to hear from him about our quarterly taxes.\" In fact, Kate hadn\\'t expected to hear from her accountant, but she hoped that an abrupt change of subject would derail Althea\\'s criticisms. Once Althea got going, it was difficult to stop her by direct means.',\n",
       " '\"He might have. I\\'ve just been so _busy_ trying to do everything alone, I didn\\'t even have time to check the phone messages,\" Althea fussed.',\n",
       " \"Kate waited until Althea turned away, then rolled her eyes. Kate's friends who ran the shops on either side of her had urged her to stop placating Althea and fire the ill-tempered old bat—show her who ran the place once and for all—but the truth was that Kate couldn't bring herself to do it. Althea knew books. She often knew what Kate needed done before Kate knew it herself. But most importantly, Althea had been hired by Kate's mother, back when Lydia Bennet had built the business from nothing more than a dream. Lydia was gone now, but the spirit of what she had made here remained. So Althea stayed, and Kate soothed and apologized.\",\n",
       " '\"Those shoes probably slow you down.\" Althea pointed a heavily lacquered fingernail toward Kate\\'s feet. \"They are lovely, though.\"',\n",
       " 'Kate stuck out one foot and turned it this way and that, displaying it for Althea\\'s approval. \"They are, aren\\'t they? I\\'m not the best with three-inch spikes, but they were half price. I think I just need practice.\"',\n",
       " 'Althea\\'s lips pursed tightly. \"Just make sure you don\\'t break an ankle while you\\'re practicing. With you in a cast, you wouldn\\'t be able to do _anything_ around here. Though, I can\\'t see how that would be much different.... \"',\n",
       " 'Kate pretended not to hear that last insult. She carried her books and her bag into the tiny back room, which was stacked with rare volumes, remainders, and damaged books that needed to be returned or repaired. She took a deep breath and inhaled the scent of old pages mixed with the briny smell of the ocean. It was an aroma that always made her happy.',\n",
       " '_This will never get old._',\n",
       " \"She ran a hand through her shoulder-length dark hair to smooth it and emerged into the front room of the store. The shop was small, with floor-to-ceiling bookshelves crammed with every possible genre: mystery, romance, literary novels, biography, history, and more. The hardwood floors and dark wood shelves created the sense that you'd gone back in time, to a library in an English country house that had seen better days but was, nonetheless, much loved. One middle-aged man in Bermuda shorts, a tank top, and wide leather sandals was browsing through the James Pattersons. Other than that, the place was empty except for Jane Austen, the Swept Away cat. This was what Althea called a rush?\",\n",
       " '\"Good morning,\" Kate said warmly to the guy in the Bermudas. \"Welcome to Swept Away. Is there anything I can help you find?\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh, no thanks, I\\'m just browsing,\" he said.',\n",
       " '\"Of course. Used mystery and crime paperbacks are buy one get one free all this week.\"',\n",
       " 'The guy brightened. \"Hey! Thanks.\"',\n",
       " 'He selected four books for a total of $4.75 plus tax. Kate finished the sale, put the books into a bag, and wished the guy a lovely time in Cambria.',\n",
       " 'He was barely out the door before it burst open again, the bell attached to the top jingling in panic. A stunning woman with long, blond hair piled into a messy bun on the top of her head exploded into the room, her arms flying.',\n",
       " '\"Kate! You\\'re here! What took you so long? Red alert! Red alert!\"',\n",
       " 'Kate\\'s eyebrows shot up. \"Really?\"',\n",
       " 'Lacy Jordan rushed behind the counter, grabbed Kate\\'s arm, and yanked her toward the door. \"Would I lie to you about a red alert?\"',\n",
       " '\"Well, no. Where? Where?\"',\n",
       " '\"In my shop! Hurry!\"',\n",
       " 'Lacy was still wearing the coffee-stained apron she sported while serving customers at the espresso place next door. Her sneakers, with faded jeans and a tight white T-shirt, allowed her more freedom of movement than Kate had in her heels and pencil skirt.',\n",
       " '\"Oh, come on!\" Lacy urged. \"Why would you wear those shoes when you know there might be a red alert?\"',\n",
       " '\"I guess I wasn\\'t thinking,\" Kate said.',\n",
       " '\"I guess not!\"',\n",
       " 'Kate click-clacked as quickly as she could across the sidewalk and past a pair of tourists, until Lacy thrust her by the arm through the door of Jitters, the coffee bar where Lacy worked. The force with which Lacy propelled her through the door caused Kate to teeter on the heels before finally righting herself.',\n",
       " '\"Where?\" she whispered, out of breath.',\n",
       " '\"Left rear corner.\"',\n",
       " 'Kate looked around the room until her eyes rested on the man sitting at a small, round café table, sipping something from a white ceramic cup.',\n",
       " '\"Oh,\" she breathed.',\n",
       " '\"Yeah.\"',\n",
       " \"It was him, all right. The first spotting had been three days earlier, at the wine tasting bar run by Rose Watkins, the third of their foursome of friends. The guy, a cross between David Beckham and Chris Hemsworth, was such a ticking bomb of sex appeal that Rose had immediately and surreptitiously called all of them over from their respective places of business to come in and get a look at him. After some discussion, they'd decided that he would be the perfect practice man for Kate, who—two years post-divorce—had recently decided she was ready to start dating again. Flirting was the first step, and who better to flirt with than a guy who could be a Calvin Klein underwear model?\",\n",
       " 'The \"red alert\" system had been created to deal with any future sightings—not only so Kate could polish up skills that had suffered from disuse, but also so the other women could get another chance to bask in his glory.',\n",
       " '\"Did you call Rose and Gen?\" Kate was whispering out of the side of her mouth, all systems in stealth mode, though Mr. Beautiful likely couldn\\'t hear them from where he sat.',\n",
       " '\"Gen\\'s not at the gallery, and Rose is stuck doing a tasting for a big group.\" She sighed. \"He\\'s all ours.\"',\n",
       " '\"Wow.\" They stood together, thinking. \"Well, I\\'m just gonna start with a stroll to the ladies\\' room. Just a little fly-by. Get a better look,\" Kate said.',\n",
       " 'Lacy clapped her on the back companionably. \"Good plan.\"',\n",
       " 'Kate took a deep breath and squared her shoulders. \"Wish me luck. I\\'m going in.\"',\n",
       " 'She did one or two cleansing breaths and then started to walk casually toward the back of the shop. Just a woman on her way to the restroom. Nothing unusual going on here at all. The trick was to look at him while pretending not to look at him. He was facing away from her now, so the stealthy looking probably would work best on the way back.',\n",
       " 'As she passed, he was looking down at a newspaper that was folded next to his coffee mug. Black T-shirt stretched across a muscular back. Three-day scruff of beard. Black hair still wet. From a shower? From a dip at the beach? From surfing? Oh, surfing. She pictured him in a skin-tight wetsuit, hair dripping with ocean water. Yum.',\n",
       " \"It was this train of thought Kate was following—just as she was passing Mr. Beautiful's table—when the heel of her left shoe went into a groove of the fashionably rough-hewn wood floor, causing her to pitch forward. She pinwheeled her arms desperately to regain her balance, but it wasn't enough to keep her from colliding with the floor with a loud _whump_.\",\n",
       " 'She was still lying there, trying to figure out how best to get up and maintain her dignity—though it was obviously too late for that—when she looked up and saw Mr. Beautiful looming over her.',\n",
       " '\"Are you okay?\" He offered her a hand, but his eyes were drifting lower. She looked down and realized that her skirt had ridden up in the fall, exposing about three-fourths of her thighs.',\n",
       " '\"Um, yeah. Everything still works, I think.\" She blushed furiously. She slapped at her skirt to put it back into place as she took his hand and got to her feet. \"Thanks.\"',\n",
       " '\"You\\'d better have a seat. Take a minute to regroup.\" He pulled out a seat at his table and ushered her into it. \"I\\'m Zach.\" He offered her the hand she\\'d only moments ago released.',\n",
       " '\"Kate.\" They shook. His grip was firm, his palm cool and smooth. \"Hey, look. I should go. I don\\'t want to interrupt you in the middle of your...\" She waved her hand vaguely. \"Your cappuccino and your newspaper and...\" More vague waving. \"... And whatever it was you were doing.\"',\n",
       " 'He nodded sagely. \"Cappuccino and newspaper do require a lot of concentration.\" One corner of his mouth quirked up in a sexy smile.',\n",
       " '\"Well.\" She blushed again. She could feel the red wave of her embarrassment start at her neck and move up toward her hairline.',\n",
       " '\"Can I buy you a coffee?\" he offered.',\n",
       " '\"Oh. I...\" Before she could answer, Lacy called over from behind the counter.',\n",
       " '\"I\\'ve got your regular going, Kate! Soy latte, extra foam. Coming up!\"',\n",
       " 'That woman could eavesdrop from the next town during a thunderstorm.',\n",
       " '\"Well, I guess that settles it,\" he said. \"You sure you didn\\'t hurt yourself? That was quite a fall.\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'m sure. Just embarrassed. I\\'m such an idiot. It\\'s these shoes. They\\'re torture devices.\"',\n",
       " 'He peered down at her shoes—fire engine red pumps with pointed toes and stiletto heels—and let out a long whistle. \"I\\'ve got to think they\\'re worth the trouble.\"',\n",
       " '\"Well, that\\'s the hope, anyway.\" She crossed her legs and watched him watch them. \"Are you in town visiting?\"',\n",
       " 'He nodded, taking a sip of his cappuccino. He licked a bit of foam from his upper lip, and Kate felt her own mouth go dry. \"Yeah. Just taking a little vacation. I\\'m staying at a B&B on the beach. The Central Coast is beautiful this time of year.\"',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s beautiful any time of year.\"',\n",
       " \"Lacy came over with Kate's latte. She set the drink on the table and shot Kate a wink before hurrying away.\",\n",
       " '\"Cambria was my wife\\'s favorite place.\"',\n",
       " '_Wife? Was?_ She tried to figure out how to ask. \"Is she...\"',\n",
       " '\"We\\'re divorced.\"',\n",
       " '\"Ah. Me too.\" Kate felt relieved that she hadn\\'t stumbled onto a grieving widower. It would be a shame if she\\'d crashed into the hardwood only to have to console him while he cried and showed her pictures of the wedding.',\n",
       " 'No sooner had she thought it than he pulled a phone from his back pocket and scrolled through his photos before showing one to Kate. \"Here she is. This is Sherry.\" His voice sounded wistful as he offered the phone to Kate.',\n",
       " '\"Wow.\" The woman in the photo was supermodel gorgeous, with long, silky black hair, eyes the color of espresso, and flawless skin the shade of warm caramel. Kate would not have been surprised to see a tiara and a sash. \"She\\'s beautiful.\"',\n",
       " '\"Yeah.\" He took the phone back and replaced it in his pocket. \"We spent our honeymoon here.\"',\n",
       " '\"In Cambria?\"',\n",
       " '\"In the same B&B.\"',\n",
       " 'Kate looked at him blankly. \"Oh. And you came here because...\"',\n",
       " '\"I guess I just wanted to feel close to her again.\" A tear came to his eye, and he brushed it away.',\n",
       " 'This encounter was so clearly going nowhere that Kate tried to think of a graceful way to excuse herself. With exquisite timing, Althea came bursting through the doorway of the café.',\n",
       " '\"Kate!\" the older woman boomed, her face red, looking pissed-off.',\n",
       " '\"Oops. I\\'m so sorry, I have to get going,\" she told Mr. Beautiful, whom she now thought of as Mr. Sad and Beautiful. \"I have to get back to work. I work next door. At the bookshop. I mean, I own it. The bookshop. I... Um. Bye. It was really nice to meet you.\"',\n",
       " 'She grabbed her latte cup and click-clicked with tiny little steps (all her pencil skirt would allow) toward the door. \"I\\'m coming, Althea. Bye, Lacy! I\\'ll see you later!\"',\n",
       " 'Lacy shot her a questioning look, a _why are you leaving without a wedding date or at least a phone number_ kind of glare. Kate put her thumb and pinkie to her face in the universal gesture of _call me_. Then she followed Althea out the door.',\n",
       " '\"Why, first you\\'re late, and then you rush out the door in some kind of \\'red alert\\' nonsense,\" the older woman was going on. \"Sometimes it\\'s like you don\\'t take your work seriously at all, Katherine. I mean, it\\'s beyond me. Your mother would never...\"',\n",
       " 'Kate let her go on, barely listening.',\n",
       " \"Her cell phone was ringing on the bookstore's counter before Kate was even all the way inside.\",\n",
       " '\"What happened? Why did you leave?\"',\n",
       " 'Kate could hear espresso machines whirring and milk steamers hissing in the background.',\n",
       " '\"Yeah, that one\\'s not gonna work out,\" Kate said.',\n",
       " '\"Why not? Is he too good looking? Is that it? Is the splendor of his beauty too much for your eyes?\"',\n",
       " '\"He\\'s mourning his wife.\"',\n",
       " '\"Oh. Yikes. Dead?\"',\n",
       " '\"Divorced. He\\'s here to relive their honeymoon. Alone. He showed me her picture.\"',\n",
       " 'Lacy was silent for a moment. \"Yeah, that\\'s not going anywhere.\"',\n",
       " '\"No.\" With the phone to her ear, Kate started leafing through a pile of paperwork Althea had thrust in front of her. With dismay she noted that it was mostly bills.',\n",
       " '\"It\\'s too bad,\" Lacy mused. \"That pratfall of yours was pure genius. Part Julia Roberts, part Lucille Ball. I\\'m in awe. I\\'m so proud. I\\'m like a proud mama.\"',\n",
       " '\"I\\'d like to say I did it on purpose, but...\"',\n",
       " '\"What?\" Lacy called out. \"What? I can\\'t hear you over the espresso machine! I can\\'t acknowledge a single thing you just said! I have to go! Bye, hon!\"',\n",
       " '# 2',\n",
       " 'The next morning, Kate woke to the sound of someone rummaging around in her kitchen, banging cabinet doors and sifting through the silverware drawer. Groggy, she looked at the clock. Six thirty-two. Pale sunlight filtered through the white linen curtains above the bed. She rolled over and tried to go back to sleep, but then she started to smell coffee, which made it impossible. Damn it.',\n",
       " \"Squinty-eyed, she emerged from the bedroom to find Genevieve Porter pouring herself a mug of black coffee in Kate's tiny kitchen.\",\n",
       " '\"You run out again?\" She rubbed her eyes and yawned.',\n",
       " '\"Yeah. I hope you don\\'t mind. You always have better coffee than I do, anyway.\"',\n",
       " '\"Mi casa es... something. It\\'s too early for foreign languages.\" Kate took a thick ceramic mug from the cupboard above the coffee pot and poured herself a cup. She added cream and an obscene amount of sugar. That first sip tasted like sweet salvation.',\n",
       " '\"Ah, God. I want to be mad at you for waking me up at six-something-ridiculous, but you made me coffee. So there\\'s that.\"',\n",
       " \"Genevieve, who rented the tiny downstairs apartment on the first floor of Kate's house, owned the Porter Gallery, a small storefront on Main Street that offered fine art as well as the seascape watercolors and ceramic tchotchkes the tourists loved. She was five-foot-two, with fiery red, curly hair that put one in mind of Merida, the Disney princess from _Brave_. Gen and Kate were, in some ways, opposites. While Gen worked out every day without fail, Kate had a vast and impressive array of excuses to avoid the gym. Where Gen was completely at home in a sheath dress and three-inch heels, Kate—as her encounter with Zach had proved—could barely manage in anything but flats. Gen was kale and egg-white omelets; Kate was Froot Loops and Pop-Tarts. Somehow, the contrasts had allowed them to complement each other in a way that had cemented their friendship from the day they'd met.\",\n",
       " 'Gen was already dressed in spandex shorts and a pink, racer-back athletic top, running shoes on her feet, her mass of unruly hair coaxed into a more subdued ponytail. \"Come for a run with me?\" she said, batting her eyes at Kate over the rim of her cup.',\n",

       " 'When Gen was gone, Kate took her coffee mug out onto the back deck and sighed as she plopped into an Adirondack chair. The house, though old, small, and in a state of mild disrepair, had one of the best views in Cambria. It sat halfway up a hill that rose above the shoreline, giving the back deck a 180-degree view of the Pacific Ocean. Morning was the best time to enjoy the view, with the sun rising gently in the east. In the afternoon, it would be glaring down on her, prompting her to reach for a sun hat, sunglasses, and, ideally, a large umbrella. Right now, though, it was perfect; in June, the air was cool but not cold even this early in the morning. She could relax in her plaid pajama pants and T-shirt without the need for a sweatshirt or a blanket to keep her comfortable.',\n",
       " \"As she sipped the strong, sweet brew, she heard sea lions barking from where they perched on the rocks below. Seagulls soared overhead. And on the grassy patch one story below, just outside Gen's back door, a doe grazed, its legs long and graceful. Kate kept quiet so she wouldn't disturb it.\",\n",
       " \"This had to be paradise, and if it wasn't, she couldn't imagine anywhere better. Maybe if she'd been raised here, maybe if she'd grown up in this town on the Central California coast, gone to school here, rode her bicycle on the winding, hilly roads day after day, she might have become so familiar with its beauty that she'd have stopped seeing it. As it was, though, she was thankful every day to find herself here, despite the influx of tourists that disrupted the quiet every summer, despite the struggle of keeping the bookstore running, despite the little things that kept going wrong with the house—the roof that needed repair, the persistent ant problem, the plumbing that made a kind of singing noise when you turned on the water. All of that was insignificant compared with waking up to this.\",\n",
       " \"Kate had inherited the house—and the business—from her mother about five years before. Lydia Bennet had been a housewife for most of her adulthood, but when Kate's father had left her for another woman ten years ago, when Kate was twenty-two, Lydia had taken it as a second chance at making a life of her own. She'd sold their house in Los Angeles, bought this place, and opened the bookstore. Lydia had hired Althea soon afterward.\",\n",
       " \"Because Kate had been busy attending UCLA and then launching her own career teaching college-level English, she'd never lived in Cambria until her mother had died of ovarian cancer. Kate had come up here to feel closer to her mother, to grieve, to heal. Then she'd fallen in love with the place and had never gotten around to leaving.\",\n",
       " \"She went inside for another cup of coffee and checked the clock. She didn't want to be late to the shop again and risk the wrath of Althea. The shop didn't open until ten a.m. on weekdays, but she'd agreed to come in early to meet with Althea to discuss their plans for the annual Cambria Art Walk.\",\n",
       " \"The Art Walk name was misleading; the event had started out, many years ago, as a way for the town to highlight the many local artists who showed their work in Cambria's galleries. Tourists and locals were encouraged to go from gallery to gallery on a warm summer evening, taking in culture and sampling hors d'oeuvres and local wines. Over the years, the event had expanded as more and more local businesses had wanted in on the action. Now, it was more of an open house that ran all up and down Main Street on one night each July. No longer was it limited to art galleries. These days, pretty much everybody—the boutiques, the coffee houses, the souvenir shops, the restaurants, and, of course, the bookstore—offered something special to visitors on the night of the Art Walk. The events and attractions included everything from live music to ceramics demonstrations to food and craft booths set up on the sidewalks. Last year, the toy store down the street had hosted a juggling show that had been a favorite among families with children.\",\n",
       " \"Althea insisted that Swept Away's usual offering—a book reading and signing, with free coffee and cookies—was the correct, and most dignified, way to go. After all, what else would a bookstore do but a reading? It made sense, Kate had to admit, but she couldn't help cringing when she remembered what had happened last year. The local author they'd brought in had been so epically boring, so inept a public speaker, that people had started walking out during the reading. To avoid embarrassing the author—a genuinely nice person and a very talented writer—Kate and Althea had rushed around on the street, finding their friends and using bribes, guilt, and quid-pro-quo promises to fill the modest number of folding chairs they'd set out in the shop. Their efforts had ultimately failed, and the author had slinked away with a crushed ego, pathetic sales, and a bakery box full of leftover cookies that had been purchased for a crowd that hadn't come.\",\n",

With her chin-length, purple hair, her nose and eyebrow piercings, and the rose tattoo that just peeked out above the neckline of her black T-shirt, she'd have been more at home in L.A. or New York City. The owner at De-Vine, an elderly woman who favored pink Lacoste polo shirts and pastel pleated slacks, had balked at first when Rose had applied for the job. But when she'd realized how much Rose really did know about wine—that Rose could tell the difference between a Napa cabernet sauvignon and one from Bordeaux simply by aroma—she'd decided that Rose's unconventional appearance was worth getting used to.\",\n",

She scooped up a pile of discarded clothes from the bedroom floor, considered putting them away, looked at the clock, and opted instead to stuff them inside the closet and close the door. When she was finished, she gave the place an appraising look. Not bad.',\n",

He didn't use women, exactly—those who had dated him tended to think well of him even after things ended. But end they did, and usually after a very brief time. But who was to say that wasn't just what Kate needed? She was getting back into dating for the first time in years. She wasn't ready to jump into anything serious. A brief and mutually satisfying fling with a man who revved her engine could be exactly the right thing for her at this point in her life. There was no harm in it. They would both have fun, and then they would part on good terms.\",\n",
